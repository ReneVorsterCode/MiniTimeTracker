# Mini Time Tracker App

This app is a mini time tracker done for a technical assessment. The app itself only has a frontend
using React + Typescript + Vite.

If not running deployed version of app, you can follow these steps to get it running:

- Open project in IDE of choice
- Open terminal and type the following if not already CDd to frontend folder.
- cd frontend
- npm install

The package manager should now install relevant packages. Once packages are installed type:

- npm run preview

This will first build the project, which will create a build in the dist folder, and then run the preview build for you. Ctrl+click on the link shown in terminal.
